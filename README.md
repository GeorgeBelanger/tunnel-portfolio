# Dev Log
  
## 2/26/19 Tuesday 3:45pm Glickman
  - Today I am going to work on getting the tunnel portfolio site working
    - First thing I am going to do is copy the codepen into a folder and make a github repo
    - Deleted all text off the page and am just left with the canvas and links
    - The focus is going to be on index 2. Things I want to change:
      - 1. Change the original particles into screenshots of my projects
        - Tried https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/textures/CubeTexture and got a shiny object that killed my render time
        - Tried https://github.com/abemID/threejstuts/blob/master/5-material-with-image.html but it said these methods were deprecated. 
      - 2. Make the particles clickable
      - 3. Change the texture of the tunnel
  - Now I see why I should have branches for projects even if I am working solo - The commits don't have to be as big. I can add just comments and such and only save the truly notable commits for master.

  - Working on portfolio again today
  - Also thought that I should make a photography website for Shunham. $100
  - Making branches now- Starting with clickable geom's
    - Going to get the click and or hover on box to work today. 
      - Not sure if I want to keep the original design or swtich to static cubes that hyperspace when you click them.
        - Starting with this tutorial https://soledadpenades.com/articles/three-js-tutorials/object-picking/
